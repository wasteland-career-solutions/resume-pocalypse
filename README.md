# Resume Pocalypse

## Description

We were tasked with creating a full stack application using Node.js, Object-Oriented Programming, Express.js, SQL, Object-Relational Mapping, and Handlebars. We chose to create a text based adventure game, that is in the theme of the Fallout video game franchise, that in the end, generates a professional resume.

## Installation

We used a combination of Node, Express, MySQL, Sequelize, Bootstrap, DotENV, Nodemon, Bcrypt, and PDFKit.
