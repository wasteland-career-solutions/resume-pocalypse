# Resume Pocalypse

## Description

We were tasked with creating a full stack application using Node.js, Object-Oriented Programming, Express.js, MySQL, Object-Relational Mapping, and Handlebars. We chose to create a text based adventure game, that is in the theme of the Fallout video game franchise, that in the end, generates a professional resume. Additionally, we used Express Handlebars, Sequelize, Bootstrap, DotENV, Nodemon, Bcrypt, and PDFKit.

## Installation

No installation necessary but you can clone the [repository](https://github.com/wasteland-career-solutions/resume-pocalypse) from GitHub to edit it and make your own version. After you have cloned the repository, you would type "npm i" into the terminal to install the NPM packages. After the packages are installed, you would put your MySQL username and password into the .env.EXAMPLE file and change its name to just ".env". Then, you would type "npm start" into the terminal to start the server. You would then type "http://localhost:3001/" into your browser to view the app as you edit it.

## Usage

When you first boot up the page, you would sign up and put in your information. It would then take you to the next page containing more user information fields that you would fill out for your resume. If you have already signed up, you would log in instead. When you select the Play Game button, the text based adventure game starts to display the questions and you answer each one. Once you have completed the game, it ends and a resume is generated.
